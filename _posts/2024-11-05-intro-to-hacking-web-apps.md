With the widespread use of web applications in today’s business environment, safeguarding them against malicious attacks has become essential. As modern web applications grow in complexity, so do the threats they face, resulting in an expansive attack surface for organizations. Consequently, web-based attacks are among the most common threats companies encounter, making web application security a <b>top</b> priority for IT departments.

Attacks on external-facing web applications can lead to a breach in a company’s internal network, potentially resulting in data theft, disrupted services, or financial loss. Even for organizations without externally accessible applications, internal web applications and publicly exposed API endpoints remain vulnerable to many of the same attacks, posing similar risks to company assets and operations.

# OWASP TOP 10

The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical security risks to web applications, compiled by the Open Web Application Security Project ([**OWASP**](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)). It highlights the most common and impactful vulnerabilities to help developers and organizations secure their web applications. The latest (2021) OWASP Top 10 categories typically include:

1. Broken Access Control - Poorly managed permissions, allowing unauthorized access.
2. Cryptographic Failures - Weak or missing encryption.
3. Injection - Malicious code (like SQL) inserted into application inputs.
4. Insecure Design - Weak security principles in application architecture.
5. Security Misconfiguration - Incorrect or incomplete security settings.
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components - Using unpatched or obsolete software.
7. Identification and Authentication Failures - Flaws in user identity verification.
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures - Untrusted software or data being executed.
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures - Insufficient logging to detect breaches.
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - Attacker can manipulate requests from a server.

The OWASP Top 10 helps developers focus on preventing these critical vulnerabilities to improve application security.
